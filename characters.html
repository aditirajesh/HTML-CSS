                    Mario is the iconic mustached plumber in red overalls, known for his bravery, optimism, and love for jumping. 
                    Whether he's stomping Goombas or saving Princess Peach, Mario is the heart and soul of the Mushroom Kingdom. 
                    From go-kart racing to smashing Bros, he does it all — and with a smile!

                    Luigi is Mario’s younger, taller, and often more anxious brother, dressed in green. While he’s usually in Mario’s shadow, 
                    Luigi shines in his own spooky adventures like Luigi’s Mansion. He’s lovable, loyal, and brings quirky charm to the duo.

                    The graceful and kind ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Peach often finds herself kidnapped by Bowser - 
                    but she’s no damsel in distress. Peach has starred in her own games, sports spin-offs, and regularly joins the fight in Super Smash Bros

                    Bowser, the King of the Koopas, is Mario’s greatest enemy — a huge, fire-breathing, spiked-shelled villain with a surprisingly soft spot for his son. 
                    While he’s always cooking up schemes to kidnap Peach and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, deep down he’s more goofy than evil.

                    Yoshi is a lovable dinosaur companion who debuted in Super Mario World. He can flutter-jump, eat enemies with his long tongue, 
                    and turn them into eggs! With his own series of platformers, Yoshi is a fan-favorite sidekick with serious star power.

                    Toad is a loyal attendant of Princess Peach, known for his mushroom-shaped head and peppy personality. 
                    Though small in size, he’s incredibly brave and often helps Mario on his quests. And yes, that high-pitched “Thank you, Mario!” voice is unforgettable.

                <p>
                    Originally Mario’s first antagonist in Donkey Kong (1981), he later became the star of his own jungle-filled franchise. 
                    DK is strong, banana-loving, and now more of a friendly rival than a foe. His ground-pounding adventures are a total blast.

                <p>
                    Greedy, loud, and mischievous, Wario is Mario’s rotund rival and the anti-hero we didn’t expect to love. 
                    He stars in the WarioWare and Wario Land series, packed with zany microgames and treasure-hunting chaos. He’s all about garlic and gold.

                <p>
                    Waluigi, Luigi’s sinister counterpart, is tall, wiry, and dripping with flair (and drama). 
                    Though he hasn’t starred in a mainline game of his own, he’s a legend in Mario sports and party games. His signature move? Being fabulously annoying.
