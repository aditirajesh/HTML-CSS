            <h2>📜 DUN DUN DUN... THE ORIGIN</h2>
            <section class="origin">
                <p>
                    Before he was the mustachioed hero we know today, Mario made his first appearance in 1981's
                    Donkey Kong - but back then, he wasn't even called Mario. He was known simply as "Jumpman", a
                    carpenter trying to rescue his girlfriend from a barrel-throwing ape.
                    <br><br>

                    The name "Mario" actually came later, inspired by <strong>Mario Segale</strong>
                    the landlord of Nintendo of America's warehouse, who supposedly barged in demanding overdue
                    rent. The team thought the name was perfect and it stuck! By 1983, Jumpman officially became Mario
                    in <strong>Mario Bros</strong> and his job title changed from carpenter to plumber, fitting the game's underground
                    pipe-filled levels. Oh, and he was suddenly from Brooklyn. And just like that, <strong>a gaming legend was born.</strong>
