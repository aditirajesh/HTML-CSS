# ** TASK 1: Static Webpage Layout**

    -  Create a single-page website using semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

## Solution:

    - created a main webpage <mainpage1.html> with semantic elements + content
    - created stylesheet <style1.css> to decorate the main page
    - created a second webpage <characters.html> and added navigation links to the main page. Decorated the page with <style2.css>
    - defined media query in <style1.css> to account for portrait mode in phones.

### Main page:

As you can see, the font size is adjusted and the body text also turns to green.
