            <section class="origin">
                <p>
                    Before he was the mustachioed hero we know today, Mario made his first appearance in 1981's
                    Donkey Kong - but back then, he wasn't even called Mario. He was known simply as "Jumpman", a
                    carpenter trying to rescue his girlfriend from a barrel-throwing ape.
                    <br><br>

                    The name "Mario" actually came later, inspired by <strong>Mario Segale</strong>
                    the landlord of Nintendo of America's warehouse, who supposedly barged in demanding overdue
                    rent. The team thought the name was perfect and it stuck! By 1983, Jumpman officially became Mario
                    in <strong>Mario Bros</strong> and his job title changed from carpenter to plumber, fitting the game's underground
                    pipe-filled levels. Oh, and he was suddenly from Brooklyn. And just like that, <strong>a gaming legend was born.</strong>

                    <div class="tabs_content">
                        <p>Long ago, the Mushroom Kingdom was a peaceful land, defended by the resourceful Toads and their hidden reserves of powerful items. 
                            But darkness fell when <strong>>Princess Peach</strong> ‚Äî the first human in the realm ‚Äî was captured by<strong> Bowser‚Äôs Koopalings</strong>.
                            Obsessed with building the ultimate army, Bowser aimed to turn humans into Goombas, crush the Toads, and rule the land. 
                            As his airships rained fire across once-lush kingdoms, he imprisoned Peach, hoping to force her into marriage. 
                            Resistance from the Toads dwindled, and Bowser‚Äôs twisted inventions ‚Äî Bullet Bills, Bob-ombs, and monstrous pipe-dwelling piranhas ‚Äî
                            turned the kingdom into a wasteland.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>Years passed until <strong>Mario</strong> ‚Äî a human who had once defeated Donkey Kong ‚Äî was captured and dropped into this war-torn world.
                            Upon escaping, he saved a young Toad and was taken into the underground resistance. 
                            There he learned of Peach‚Äôs fate and the horrors the kingdom had endured. 
                            Armed with only a few hidden items and the last 1-Up Mushroom, Mario became the symbol of hope ‚Äî ‚ÄúJumpman,‚Äù the hero who defied the odds. 
                            One by one, he destroyed Bowser‚Äôs fortresses, defeated his monstrous creations, and sparked fear even in the tyrant himself.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>In a final desperate stand, Bowser unleashed a star-powered weapon meant to burn Mario alive. But the hero endured. 
                            After battling through airships, armies, and flames, Mario reached Bowser‚Äôs lair and defeated the king with his bare hands, 
                            rescuing Peach and restoring peace. Joined by his brother Luigi, the trio remained in the Mushroom Kingdom as heroes and rulers. 
                            Peace returned, but somewhere in the shadows, Bowser plotted again. And as for Mario's many versions ‚Äî from baby to paper to plumber ‚Äî 
                            well, perhaps in another timeline‚Ä¶ with another Mario.</p>

                        <h3>Mario and Peach</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Mario</strong> and <strong>Princess Peach</strong> share a special bond. 
                            He‚Äôs always ready to rescue her whenever <strong>Bowser</strong> causes trouble, and over time, their friendship (and maybe more!) 
                            has grown stronger. But in <strong>Super Princess Peach</strong>, she flips the script and saves Mario instead!
                        </p>
                          
                        <h3>Mario and Pauline</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before Peach, Mario‚Äôs first big rescue was for <strong>Pauline</strong>, his old friend from the original <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> game.
                            Pauline still shows up now and then, especially in <strong>Super Mario Odyssey</strong>, where she‚Äôs the stylish mayor of New Donk City 
                            and a good friend to Mario.
                        </p>
                          
                        <h3>Mario and Luigi</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Luigi</strong> is Mario‚Äôs younger twin brother. He‚Äôs taller, a bit more shy, but can jump even higher! 
                            They team up in many games, and Luigi has even saved Mario a few times‚Äîlike in the spooky <strong>Luigi‚Äôs Mansion</strong> series.
                        </p>
                          
                        <h3>Princess Daisy and Luigi</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Princess Daisy</strong> was rescued by Mario in <strong>Super Mario Land</strong>, 
                            but nowadays, she‚Äôs more closely connected to <strong>Luigi</strong>. 
                            Some say she‚Äôs Luigi‚Äôs version of Peach, and they make a pretty great team!
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Mario and Wario</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Wario</strong> is Mario‚Äôs rival and total opposite‚Äîgreedy, messy, and always looking for treasure. 
                            They clash a lot, but deep down, Wario‚Äôs more silly than evil.
                        </p>
                          
                        <h3>Mario and Yoshi</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Yoshi</strong> is Mario‚Äôs trusted dino-pal. He helps carry Mario through tricky worlds, gobbles up enemies, 
                            and is always ready to help save the day. He even raised <strong>Baby Mario</strong> in <strong>Yoshi‚Äôs Island</strong>!
                        </p>
                          
                        <h3>Mario and Toad</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Toad</strong> is a loyal friend to both Mario and Peach. He offers helpful advice, keeps the castle running, and 
                            sometimes joins in on adventures himself!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The classic red-and-white mushroom that makes Mario grow big and strong!

                        <h3>üî• Fire Flower</h3>
                        <p>
                            When Mario grabs this fiery flower, he gets a white suit and can throw fireballs! Great for 
                            zapping Goombas and melting trouble away.
                        </p>

                            This gives Mario a raccoon tail and ears! He can glide, fly for a bit, 
                            and even spin his tail to swat enemies.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>üëª Boo Mushroom</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mario turns into a ghost and can float through walls! Spooky and super cool ‚Äî 
                            but don‚Äôt let the light hit him!
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>üí´ 1-Up Mushroom</h3>
                        <p>
                            The green mushroom that gives Mario an extra life. 
                            Always a joy to find, especially when things get tough!
